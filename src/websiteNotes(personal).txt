Web notes:

because image is fixed, maybe have it so content in the image changes depending on where i am at scroll?
can access local stuff pretty easily, just go to the public folders. So I'll link my writing stuff there, and resume


WILL DO MOBILE SPECIFIC CSS ONCE SITE IS DONE!
Some css to add is including vector images for the companies, for better zoom
also do stuff to make the website faster. to work on that later

A lot of Css issues, specifically @ different zooms. For now, work at 80% zoom and get content and general style/look
I want. Work on overhaul of css and styling to make it look nice for all setting at a later date (once i'm done the first draft of site)
