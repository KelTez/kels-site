Web notes:

because image is fixed, maybe have it so content in the image changes depending on where i am at scroll?
can access local stuff pretty easily, just go to the public folders. So I'll link my writing stuff there, and resume


WILL DO MOBILE SPECIFIC CSS ONCE SITE IS DONE!

A lot of Css issues, specifically @ different zooms. For now, work at 80% zoom and get content and general style/look
I want. Work on overhaul of css and styling to make it look nice for all setting at a later date (once i'm done the first draft of site)
